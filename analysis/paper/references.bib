 abstract="The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",

	abstract = {Understanding the risks associated with the likelihood of extreme events and their respective consequences for the stability of hydraulic infrastructures is essential for flood forecasting and engineering design purposes. Accordingly, a hydrological methodology for providing reliable estimates of extreme discharge flows approaching hydraulic infrastructures was developed. It is composed of a preliminary assessment of missing data, quality and reliability for statistically assessing the frequency of flood flows, allied to parametric and non-parametric methods. Model and parameter uncertainties are accounted for by the introduced and proposed modified model averaging (modified MM) approach in the extreme hydrological event's prediction. An assessment of the parametric methods accuracy was performed by using the non-parametric Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) as a benchmark model. For demonstration and validity purposes, this methodology was applied to estimate the design floods approaching the case study ‚Äònew Hintze Ribeiro bridge‚Äô, located in the Douro river, one of the three main rivers in Portugal, and having one of Europe's largest river flood flows. Given the obtained results, the modified MM is considered a better estimation method.},
